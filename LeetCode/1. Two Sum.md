# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

We have an array `nums` from which we wish to find exactly two integers
whose sum is equal to `target`.

To solve the problem, it is good practice to build an example to work with.

Let `nums` be the following:
 
 ---------------------------------
 | 5 | 4 | 8 | 3 | 6 | 2 | 9 | 1 |
 ---------------------------------

A simple first thought would be to check the sum of each possible pair on 
numbers that will add up to the value of `target`. That is the brute force
approach.

## Brute Force 

```python3
def two_sum_brute_force(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    pass
```
